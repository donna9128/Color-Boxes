# Color-Boxes
The goal was to recreate jennifer dewalt's technicolor boxes site. Through this assignment we were able to learn concepts in HTML, CSS and Javascript. This was the first completed functioning version. We hard coded the div's to create boxes, but didn't optimize the code and make it more efficient yet. Should work on a for loop to write the divs for me and do it once the screen is loaded.
